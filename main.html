        Inception is a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, 
        who also produced the film with Emma Thomas, his wife. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a professional 
        thief who steals information by infiltrating the subconscious, and is offered a chance to have his criminal record erased 
        as payment for a task considered to be impossible: "inception", the implantation of another person's idea into a target's subconscious.
